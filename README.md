# File Format Project Template

This is a template for a file format project, with a few basic features and sensible defaults.

## Setup

Optional, if you use `nvm` (highly recommended):

```bash
nvm use # 17.8.0 by default
```

Install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

and run the project:

```bash
npm start
```
